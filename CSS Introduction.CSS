 CSS is a styling language, not a programming language. It is used to control the layout and appearance
of web pages, but it does not have the ability to perform actions or execute code like a programming
language. CSS is typically used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic web pages.
CSS is used for presentation  and of the web pages.
It builds on my creativity.

CSS Syntax
 selector{
    Property 1: value;
    property 2: value; 

 }
 We have many different types of selectors.

 CSS Selectors
 CSS has many types of selectors but the main ones are: Element, class and ID selectors.

 Element Selectors are as follows.
 h1{
    color: blue;
 }
This turns all H1 blue.
Any html element can be used as an element selector. I.E header, div, footer, span, strong etc.
The most common and most useful selector is the class selector.
The class selector, lets me select any html element based on their classes. i.e 
<h1 class="big header">
title
</h1>
A class is just an attribute that all html elements can have.
And it is used in CSS to distinguish elements for specific styling.
In order to select element by class, we need to use a period for that.
 .class-name{
     property: value;
 }
