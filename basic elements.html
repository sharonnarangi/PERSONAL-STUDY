Most html elements have tags. They are opening tags and closing tags.
However we have elements without  closing tags or content like
<img src="" alt=""> they are called empty tags.
STRUCTURE OF AN HTML element
<OPENING TAG> CONTENT</CLOSING TAG>
    The element could either be content text or other html elements.
    <header></header>
    The header element tells me that the content is the header and not footer of our page.
    <nav></nav>
    This tells the browser that  it is the navigation section of our web page
    Found on the top or side of the page.
